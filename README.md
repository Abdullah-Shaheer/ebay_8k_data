# eBay Scraping 

### 📝 Project Overview
In this project, I scraped product data from eBay using Python's **Requests** and **BeautifulSoup** libraries. The scraping was done efficiently to gather key product details like title, price, description, and other relevant information from the listings.

### 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to fetch eBay product pages.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML and extracting structured data.

The scraping process was completed for up to **8,000** product records. The data includes, but is not limited to:
- Product titles
- Price
- Description
- Product URLs

### 🚀 Features
- **Efficient Scraping**: Extracted data with precision and minimal delay using the requests library.
- **Data Export**: The scraped data was exported into **CSV** and **JSON** formats for easy access and further analysis.
- **Scalability**: Capable of extracting data from multiple product pages in bulk.

### ✅ Successful Outcome
The project was successful in collecting up to **8,000 product listings**, and the data was provided to the client in a structured format. The scraping process was optimized for speed and accuracy.
